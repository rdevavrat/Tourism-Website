    The acquisition of companies, intellectual property and talented individuals has been central to our growth strategy. In 2010, we acquired TSI and its subsidiaries in order to 
expand our B2B business, particularly our international air ticketing for small and medium scale enterprises. In 2012, we acquired Travelguru B2B and B2C entities from Travelocity, 
which remain well-established hotel aggregators in India. Through this acquisition, we expanded our hotel business by establishing more direct hotel relationships in India and 
improved our inventory of affordable travel options. We have also leveraged our leading position in the Indian travel ecosystem to make several ‚Äúacqui-hires‚Äù, including the teams 
from mGaadi and dudegenie, in order to grow our business.
